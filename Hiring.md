Performance Engineering &mdash; Image Processing Optimisation
==============================================================

This challenge serves as the basis for the technical interview.

Please read this document *carefully* and tell us *before starting the challenge*
- the tech stack (programming languages and frameworks) you want to use,
- if any aspect is unclear to you,
- if you want to change / reduce the scope to better fit your time schedule,
- how much effort in your estimate you will need to finish it, and
- when you can finish the task.

We understand that you have other priorities and can not commit full time to completing the challenge.
Thus spend your time economically:
- You don't need to waste time on debugging. 
  If something doesn't work, just document it in the code.
- If anything is unclear, write us instead of guessing what we expect. 
- You don't need to learn a new technology. 
  We can adapt the challenge so that you can solve it with what you already know.

Don't hesitate to write us if you have any questions during the challenge.


Tasks
-----

Read [README.md](./README.md) for the overall task and how we evaluate your code.

- [ ] Fork this repository.
- [ ] Amend this README file if clarifcations are required.
- [ ] Implement the blurring algorithm that can run both on CPU only as well as with GPU acceleration.
- [ ] Provide unit tests for your code. 
- [ ] Document how to set up, run and test your code. 
- [ ] Fill out the self-evaluation matrix, see below.
- [ ] Make a pull request if you think you are done.

Deliverables
------------

- [ ] Code.
- [ ] Units Tests.
- [ ] Documentation.
- [ ] Self-evaluation matrix.
- [ ] Pull request.


Self-evaluation matrix
----------------------

Please fill out the following table. 
Your answers serve as a basis for the technical interview and later
help us to assign you work that is most suited to your competence and preferences.

We do **not require** any minimum points in your self-evaluation.

In the field **Competence**, assess your own competence for the respective technology (0 - 4 points):
- 0: I don't know what it is.
- 1: I have heard of it and can Google some simple problems.
- 2: I consider myself experienced it it.
- 3: I consider myself an expert in it.
- 4: I can re-create it after a zombie apocalypse.

In the field **Preference**, tell us your preference for the respective technology (0 - 4 points):
- 0: I would rather quit the job than working with it.
- 1: Working with it causes me psychological pain.
- 2: I neither like nor dislike it.
- 3: I like it.
- 4: I love it.

Feel free to expand the table with **additional skills** you want to mention.
